MS6514GUI
=========

A Processing GUI for the MS6514 digital thermometer from Mastech. It might work for some other meters from Mastech too with possible small changes to the serial interpreter.

This is a quick and dirty implementation of a simple GUI in Processing for the Mastech MS6514. It has a simple serial over USB connection.
The interface has all the info available on the LCD on the meter itself and all the buttons.
Temperature measurements are logged in a graph and can be saved to a file.

I had to reverse engineer the serial protocol, so there might still be bugs present.

Software provided as is. Contact me for more info.
